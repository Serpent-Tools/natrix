/// Panic on debug builds only
///
/// This lives in a gray zone between normal panics and Result/Option.
/// It should be preferred over `panic!` in basically every case, but whether its better than
/// `Result` or `Option` comes down to what a caller can reasonably be expected to do in the error
/// case.
///
/// For example, most uses of this is in framework internals, where the entire callstack is pure
/// natrix code. there is no library user to make a decision. so if we used `Result`/`Option` we
/// would just push the "ignore it" decision to the top of the stack.
/// instead panicking early gives a better pointer to the error location, as well as allows for
/// easier recovery paths in release builds.
///
/// This should only be used when the error path is the result of a bug in the framework or user
/// code, *not for errors that can reasonably happen because of end user input*. For example if say
/// `replaceChild` call fails thats very unexpected and we flag it in debug builds, because likely
/// the developer did some strange dom modification outside of the framework.
/// But in release, well we can survive missing a dom update.
///
/// TL;DR: Use this when an error both indicates a serious bug in framework or user code, and there
/// is a reasonable way to recover from it in release builds.
///
/// *IMPORTANT:* Using this for user bugs need to be carefully thought about, failling to check
/// user inputs for validity is *not* a bug this should catch, and should use `Option`/`Result`
/// instead. This should only be used for stuff that is 100% a framework bug, or user doing
/// something very cursed.
