ADDITIONAL TERMS

1. Installation Support  
   The *only* officially supported installation method for the `natrix-cli`  
   is compiling from source via crates.io (for example:  
   ```  
   cargo install natrix-cli  
   ```  
   ). Any other distribution of pre-compiled binaries is at the sole  
   discretion of the distributor, who assumes full responsibility for  
   inspecting and verifying compatibility with all dependency licenses  
   and for complying with their terms.

2. Dependency­ License Compatibility  
   The `natrix` framework and `natrix-cli` make **no** warranty, express or  
   implied, regarding the compatibility, validity, or compliance of any  
   third-party dependency licenses.  It is the sole responsibility of any  
   party distributing binaries or derivative works containing this software  
   (or its dependencies) to inspect, verify, and ensure that such distribution  
   does not violate any applicable license or proprietary rights.

3. No Additional Restrictions  
   Nothing in these Additional Terms shall be construed to limit the rights  
   granted under the MIT License above.  In the event of any conflict  
   between the MIT License and these Additional Terms, the provisions of the  
   MIT License shall prevail to the extent necessary to preserve the  
   permissions granted therein.
