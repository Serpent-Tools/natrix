# Usage in other frameworks

The [`mount_at`](reactivity::mount::mount_at) function can be used to mount a natrix element at a custom location.
This function will return a [`RenderResult`](reactivity::mount::RenderResult) that should be kept alive until the element is unmounted.
And ideally dropped when the element is unmounted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features that depend on the natrix build pipeline will not work unless the application is built with `natrix build`.
> If you do not wish to build the final application with natrix, you can use the `natrix build` command to build the application and then copy files such as `styles.css` from natrixses `dist` folder to your application.
