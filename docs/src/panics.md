# Panic Policy

The framework makes liberal use of debug only panics, but is very careful about panics in release! its our goal that any issues should be highlighted in debug builds, but not in release builds. On release builds natrix will silently fail in many cases, this is to ensure that the framework does not panic in production.

## When does Natrix panic (in debug builds)?

### Very unlikely
- **Js Environment Corruption** - If something causes requires javascript methods to be missing, or otherwise fail.
  - In release natrix will skip executing the action it attempted, for example creating a dom node.
- **Unexpected Dom State** - If natrix cant find a expected dom node or the node isnt of the expected type.
  - Natrix will skip updating that part of the dom tree
- **Internal Borrow Errors** - Natrix uses `RefCell` internally, but the api design means panics should be impossible.
    - Natrix will skip handling the event/message, this might lead to dropped messages.

### User Errors
- **Other Validations** A few methods have debug_asserts, listing all of them would be impractical.

## When does Natrix panic (in release builds)?

### Very unlikely
- **Window or Document Not Found** - If the window or document is not found, natrix will panic.
- **Mount Not Found** - if [`mount`](reactivity::mount::mount) fails to find the standard natrix mount point it will error.

### User Errors
- **User Panics** - This one should be obvious.
- **Using `.call_read`/`.call_mut` in async**: All async code should use `.call_failable` or they might panic.

## What does natrix do in the case of a panic?
Unlike native rust, a panic in wasm does not prevent the program from continuing. This can lead to unexpected behavior if state is left in a invalid state, or worse lead to undefined behavior.
Therefor natrix will always do its best to prevent further rust execution after a panic, this is done by checking a panic flag at the start of every event handler, natrix also effectively freezes all async code using a special wrapping future that stops propagation of `.poll` calls on panic.
